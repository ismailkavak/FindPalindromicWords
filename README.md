# Palindrome Checker

This Java program checks if a given word is a palindrome using two different methods. Users can enter a word, and the program will determine if it reads the same backward as forward. Here's an overview of the methods:

## Method 1: Iterative Comparison

- The first method (`isPalindrome`) uses an iterative approach to check if the given word is a palindrome.
- It compares characters from the beginning and end of the word until the middle is reached.
- If characters at corresponding positions do not match, the word is not a palindrome.

## Method 2: String Reversal

- The second method (`isPalindrome2`) reverses the given word using a loop and compares it with the original word.
- If the reversed word is identical to the original, the word is a palindrome.

## Usage

1. Run the `Main` class.
2. Enter a word when prompted.
3. The program will indicate whether the word is a palindrome or not using both methods.
